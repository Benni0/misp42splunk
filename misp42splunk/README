misp42splunk app connects MISP and Splunk.

The app is designed to be easy to install, set up and maintain using the Splunk GUI without directly editing files.
MISP instances must be version 2.4.97 or above (new REST API).

You can use as many MISP instances as you like!
- Default instance: one instance is defined in app setup screen (together with proxy settings). You are invited to do it at setup time.
- then edit the lookup table misp_instances.csv to add other instances that you can call in custom commands with field misp_instance=instance_name and in alert actions with the input text "misp_instance"

You can register several MISP instances to use them in splunk searches and alert actions. Simply edit the file misp_instances.csv and add a row with your inputs
If the file does not exists go to Splunk GUI > Manage Apps > MISP42 Setup

headers are: misp_instance,misp_url,misp_key,misp_verifycert,misp_use_proxy,description

The main use cases are:
1. MISP to SPLUNK:
| mispgetioc params | ... gets MISP event attributes into Splunk search pipeline.
| mispapireport params | ... gets MISP event attributes into Splunk search pipeline.
search ... |mispsearch field=myvalue | ... searches for matching attributes in MISP.
search ... |mispsight field=myvalue | ... gets sighting information for a specific value (note that if there is FP, only first hit is returned)

2. MISP for SPLUNK: 2 Splunk alert actions are available
one action to create or edit events. NEW in > 2.0.14, if you provide an eventid (or UUID), then this event is edited instead of creating a new one. This allows to contribute to misp event(s) across several alert triggers.
one action to increment attribute sighting in a MISP instance.
