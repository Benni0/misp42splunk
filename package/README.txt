Introduction

This TA alows interaction between your [Splunk](www.splunk.com) search head (cluster) and one or several [MISP](http://www.misp-project.org/) instance(s). It is a versatile TA that acts as a wrapper of MISP API to either collect MISP information into Splunk (custom commands) or push information from Splunk to MISP (alert actions).
The TA is designed to be easy to install, set up and maintain using the Splunk GUI.
